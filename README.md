## Project Overview

The "Age Calculator" is a simple yet elegant web application designed to calculate the user's age based on their input of date of birth. The application is implemented with a clean user interface that allows users to input their day, month, and year of birth. Upon submission, the application calculates and displays the age in years, months, and days, accompanied by a visually appealing progressive number animation.

The project is entirely written in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with no reliance on third-party libraries. This ensures lightweight pages and straightforward maintainability. Vite is used as the build tool to serve and bundle the project for production.

## Main Personal Objectives

- Try to use GitHub features such as "Issues", "Pull Requests", "Actions", "Projects" as much as possible.
- Write a comprehensive README documentation of the project.
- Set up a branch strategy and review your code before every merge onto `main`.
- Focus on the management aspects of the development process.
